# RoundZer0

### Revolutionizing the Hiring Process with AI-Powered Interviews
RoundZer0 is a platform designed to transform the hiring process by using AI for initial candidate interviews. The goal is to create a fair and unbiased recruitment system that evaluates candidates based on their skills and potential, rather than prior commercial experience.

### Why RoundZer0?
Traditional hiring processes often overlook talented individuals due to biases or a lack of formal experience. RoundZer0 tackles this issue by conducting AI-driven "Round Zero" interviews tailored to specific job roles. These interviews ensure every candidate has an equal opportunity to demonstrate their abilities, leveling the playing field for all applicants.

### Benefits for Employers
RoundZer0 simplifies recruitment by providing pre-screened candidates evaluated through AI-powered interviews. This saves time and resources, allowing recruiters to focus on meaningful face-to-face interactions in later interview stages.

### Vision
The vision behind RoundZer0 is to build a hiring process that prioritizes talent, inclusivity, and efficiency. By fostering a process driven by potential rather than resumes, this project aims to make job opportunities accessible to everyone and help employers identify the best talent for their teams.
